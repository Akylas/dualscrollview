DualScrollView
===========

DualScrollView is an Android component. It's a simple update of the native ScrollView to support scroll in both directions. The work started with TwoDScrollView. But i was missing too many features. So i decided to rewrite it all. I should mention that the min API is 9


How it works
===========

It has exactly the same API as the ScrollView

TODO
===========

Fix wrong edge effect when on one limit (horizontal or vertical)
